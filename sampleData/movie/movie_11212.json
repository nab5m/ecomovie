Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Bink's parents; especially the three enterprising kidnapers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnaping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals.","popularity":10.262,"poster_path":"/21U2jwl36hoTHsXB3fDuIQkcchu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-07-01","revenue":16671505,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Bib.
