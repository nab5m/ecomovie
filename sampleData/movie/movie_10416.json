The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care?","popularity":10.939,"poster_path":"/2VtgMZPj3uDLz0zOQqZ74SUZGK4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To save his planet, an alien must find a woman on Earth to have his baby.
