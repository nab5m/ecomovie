He's convinced that he killed his mother on the day he was born and is certain he's already been condemned to purgatory. Deciding he might be able to knock off a few years of his sentence by doing good deeds, Sebastian sets out to find a wife for his father Lorenz. When Lorenz and Sebastian's schoolteacher Veronika fall madly in love with each other, it seems the heavens must be smiling. There's just one hitch: Veronika is married.","popularity":4.6,"poster_path":"/2pbiCR1YZNqYVKAzuCPZQCoEGCY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roxy Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grave Decisions","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":55}
