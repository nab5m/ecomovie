One of the more extreme communes, the Taylor-Eriksson cult, carries its \"quest for self-knowledge\" to a malevolent end, with numerous group members trapped, tortured, murdered and mutilated. Tears of Kali tells their twisted and disturbing story. Mathieu Carriere, Peter Martell, Cora Chilcott, Vronie Kiefer, and Nuran Celik head the ensemble cast.","popularity":1.769,"poster_path":"/2jA6b0xt9TkPSQpH8ZSJ0KBvLEg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tears of Kali","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":6}
