Folke Nilsson (Tomas Norström) is assigned to study the habits of Isak Bjørvik (Joachim Calmeyer). By the rules of the research institute, Folke has to sit on an umpire's chair in Isak's kitchen and observe him from there, but never talk to him. Isak stops using his kitchen and observes Folke through a hole in the ceiling instead. However, the two lonely men slowly overcome the initial post-war Norwegian-Swede distrust and become friends.","popularity":4.049,"poster_path":"/srIgymX8L1uYlNkRUVbOEYfcGex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":3792,"logo_path":null,"name":"BOB Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":4227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bulbul Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kitchen Stories","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":52}
