When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.","popularity":25.656,"poster_path":"/npHNjldbeTHdKKw28bJKs7lzqzj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3,"logo_path":"/1TjvGVDMYsj6JBxOAkUHpPEwLf7.png","name":"Pixar","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-22","revenue":623722818,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's dying to become a chef.","title":"Ratatouille","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":11048}
