Hunted down, with nowhere to run, they seek refuge in the only place the police cannot follow, a Cistercian monastery. Cut off from the outside world, a nightmare stand off develops between the fugitives, ready to kill in defence of their dearly purchased freedom, and the monks they' re holding hostage. But in this potentially lethal confrontation, nothing is quite as it seems. The game' s been rigged from the start. Requiem' s a violent and fast paced French film that really delivers.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":819,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidélité Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bee Movies","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":115911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ecriture","origin_country":""},{"id":23893,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Office","origin_country":""},{"id":18326,"logo_path":"/p7b7j4Or3MRPnPEBEsiSlfeZCpx.png","name":"A Plus Image 4","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-12-28","revenue":60700,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
