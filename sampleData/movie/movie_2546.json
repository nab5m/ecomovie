He and the viewer get more than they bargained for, however, in this anarchic comedy that rides roughshod over the City of Light. Based on a popular novel by Raymond Queneau that had been considered unadaptable, the audacious Zazie dans le Métro, made with flair on the cusp of the French New Wave, is a bit of stream-of-consciousness slapstick, wall-to-wall with visual gags, editing tricks, and effects.","popularity":7.25,"poster_path":"/kxEhcNZflVpj2DpxdOIxkcN4lbV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":753,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nouvelles Éditions de Films (NEF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Liberté...
