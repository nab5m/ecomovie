Following the story somewhat, friends of the new King Rudolph of Ruritania fear for his life, and switch him with a look-a-like London cabby. Throw in two(!) lovely blondes, treachery, and a battle for life and honour, and enjoy life at its zaniest.","popularity":3.632,"poster_path":"/7ltgqtFA5XTeEy3QBWmOp7tglkn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prisoner of Zenda","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":18}
