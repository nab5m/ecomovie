Stumped law enforcement geniuses half-seriously hire a disgraced, disheveled private detective with a long-ago history of super-crime solving. The alienated South Korean youngster Lee Byeong-gu builds an isolated basement command post/torture chamber/film studio to force the awful truth out of the slimy, uncooperative politicians and businesspeople, then alert the public. Byeong-gu is helped by his devoted girlfriend, who buys his theories, but wonders if his horrible childhood has colored his thinking.","popularity":9.182,"poster_path":"/kou9TDjveVwBhWnxCRUT88RUVCs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7036,"logo_path":"/javbyY0ZCvlFJtly3tpZqf2NwLX.png","name":"CJ Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":3657,"logo_path":"/2YXnZa6yPjxdHKzBLgmf57D8QpM.png","name":"Sidus","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2003-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Save the Green Planet!","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":97}
