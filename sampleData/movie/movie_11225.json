It is an intimate portrayal of the everyday lives of Carthusian monks of the Grande Chartreuse, high in the French Alps (Chartreuse Mountains). The idea for the film was proposed to the monks in 1984, but the Carthusians said they wanted time to think about it. The Carthusians finally contacted Gröning 16 years later to say they were now willing to permit Gröning to shoot the movie, if he was still interested.","popularity":2.566,"poster_path":"/aPJDt527Hy1oPnMmGEvXU14ZK6n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philip-Gröning-Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into Great Silence","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":19}
