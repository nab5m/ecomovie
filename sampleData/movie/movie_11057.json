The students form a resistance cell which they name the \"White Rose\" after a newsletter that is secretly distributed to the student body. At first small in numbers and fearful of discovery, the White Rose begins to gain massive support after a Nazi Gauleiter nearly incites a student riot after a provokative speech. At this point, the matter is taken over by the German Gestapo, who pledge to hunt down and destroy the members of the White Rose.","popularity":2.046,"poster_path":"/e7IzrfS8GpbH56JaUT3zBIQl7cf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Rose","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9}
