Z, a leftist rabble rouser, is killed in what appears to be a traffic accident. But given the political climate, the death of such a prominent activist raises troubling questions. Though it's too late to save Z's life, a postmortem examination suggests that the ruling party was behind his death. As the facts leak out, those who tell the truth pay the price for their honesty.","popularity":7.332,"poster_path":"/sHPwsRJvKUYrHAnXO0oFkPtnFjI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valoria Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1969-02-26","revenue":83305,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He is alive!","title":"Z","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":207}
