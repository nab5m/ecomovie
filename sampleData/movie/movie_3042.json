But something goes wrong in the laboratory and the doctor’s hideous creation (Randy Quaid, National Lampoon’s Vacation) disappears into the night. At first, Frankenstein hoped that the horrible monster would perish in the wilderness, but now he senses that it’s alive and sets out for him. Dr. Frankenstein tracks the creature to the Arctic, where the two must battle to decide who will become the master of the other’s life…or death. “Nobody’s ever done a Frankenstein like this one and nobody’s ever done a better one” (Houston Chronicle).","popularity":2.013,"poster_path":"/osjlYkk2dIJvbOHTwghboKWfl8k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turner Pictures (I)","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frankenstein","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4}
