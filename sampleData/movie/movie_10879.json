He is her polar opposite: he chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything - he also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny dipping.","popularity":8.577,"poster_path":"/lXpbYJQJ7tvYZ8S29Nwpzsh07PN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175,"logo_path":"/trtXLj3zv8T9ke1Vhw4SCkkM4JJ.png","name":"Caravan Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9195,"logo_path":"/ou5BUbtulr6tIt699q6xJiEQTR9.png","name":"Touchstone Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-06-29","revenue":61947267,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Romance Was Never More Dangerous!","title":"I Love Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":118}
