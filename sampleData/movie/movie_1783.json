Capt. Ernest Gordon (Ciaran McMenamin), Lt. Jim Reardon (Kiefer Sutherland) and Maj. Ian Campbell (Robert Carlyle) are among the military officers kept imprisoned and routinely beaten and deprived of food. While Campbell wants to rebel and attempt an escape, Gordon tries to take a more stoic approach, an attitude that proves to be surprisingly resonant.","popularity":8.219,"poster_path":"/4fXRE02M2EckpGPZNbuZIo05dmL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argyll Film Partners","origin_country":""},{"id":1160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gummshoe Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Integrity Partners","origin_country":""},{"id":1162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pray For Rain Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To End All Wars","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":85}
