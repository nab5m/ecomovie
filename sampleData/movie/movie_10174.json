Filmed in black and white, with the concert pieces in glittering MTV color, it is an intimate look at the work of the music performer, from a prayer circle with the dancers before each performance to bed games with the dance troupe afterwards.","popularity":11.135,"poster_path":"/A16IjPcedRgntxfGdYCkQo4ykOH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14,"logo_path":"/m6AHu84oZQxvq7n1rsvMNJIAsMu.png","name":"Miramax","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artisan Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madonna: Truth or Dare","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":81}
