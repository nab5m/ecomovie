Decisions: treatment? work? how to tell his lover and his family. He remembers the sea and himself as a child. He stares in the mirror. He's cruel: facing death, he pushes people away - what's the point? He visits his grandmother to tell her; on the way, he chats briefly with a waitress. He looks at old photos, visits a childhood tree house. He takes pictures. Returning from his grandmother's, he stops for food and sees the waitress, Jany, again. She makes a request. He returns to an empty flat - his lover has left. Can Jany's proposition give him a way to move past self-pity?","popularity":4.026,"poster_path":"/w7d8ItIHjSFLYbPT8EDf189ISi0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidélité Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time to Leave","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":55}
