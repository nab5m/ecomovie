Jurgens loves the service, even though he barely tolerates the Hitler regime. Sickened by wartime Nazi atrocities, Jurgens renounces his government, and is imprisoned and tortured as a result. Once released, the general takes pity on a downtrodden Jewish family. This isolated act of kindness is a point in his favor when Jurgens stands before Satan himself for his final judgment. The Devil's General was based on an immensely successful postwar play by German author Carl Zuckmeyer.","popularity":2.33,"poster_path":"/pqY681lsUg6RqsEHPImMxcit5Ly.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Real-Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1955-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's General","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":15}
