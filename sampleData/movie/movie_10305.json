Mika is the couture-attired, oh-so-perfect head of Muller Chocolates--a company that manufactures Swiss chocolates. Andre is her suave, concert pianist husband whose first wife died years ago in a mysterious car accident. When Jeanne, a beautiful young woman, enters the home of Mika and Andre, raising questions about her possible relationship to the family, tensions mount, alliances shift, and all the while, Mika prepares and faithfully serves her special recipe for hot chocolate each evening.","popularity":5.054,"poster_path":"/q1ncsbvcLtCeJiIVZskAzGBkwow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cab Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":6274,"logo_path":null,"name":"MK2 Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merci pour le chocolat","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":43}
