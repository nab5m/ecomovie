By coincidence, Jakob Heym eavesdrops on a German radio broadcast announcing the Soviet Army is making slow by steady progress towards central Europe. In order to keep his companion in misfortune, Mischa, from risking his life for a few potatoes, he tells him what he heard and announces that he is in possession of a radio - in the ghetto a crime punishable by death. It doesn't take long for word of Jakob's secret to spread - suddenly, there is new hope and something to live for - and so Jakob finds himself in the uncomforting position of having to come up with more and more stories.","popularity":2.564,"poster_path":"/oiRpUkdsorCypbTDxqDED9BRRCj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":87970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gruppe \"Johannisthal\"","origin_country":"XG"},{"id":1931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmové studio Barrandov","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacob the Liar","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":15}
