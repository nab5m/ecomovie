Once he arrives at training camp for his 13-week officer's course, Mayo runs afoul of abrasive, no-nonsense drill Sergeant Emil Foley. Mayo is an excellent cadet, but a little cold around the heart, so Foley rides him mercilessly, sensing that the young man would be prime officer material if he weren't so self-involved. Zack's affair with a working girl is likewise compromised by his unwillingness to give of himself.","popularity":11.532,"poster_path":"/nloIjLT5EFl4PUfbV6acxx4yiH7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/fycMZt242LVjagMByZOLUGbCvv3.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lorimar Film Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-07-28","revenue":129795554,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life gave him nothing, except the courage to win...and a woman to love.","title":"An Officer and a Gentleman","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":617}
