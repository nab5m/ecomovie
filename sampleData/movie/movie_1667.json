They walk, marching day and night in single file 70 miles into the darkest, driest and coldest continent on Earth.  Morgan Freeman narrates this amazing, true-life tale touched with humour and alive with thrills. Breathtaking photography captures the transcendent beauty and staggering drama of devoted parent penguins who, in the fierce polar winter, take turns guarding their egg and trekking to the ocean in search of food. Predators hunt them, storms lash them. But the safety of their adorable chicks makes it all worthwhile. So follow the leader ... to adventure!!","popularity":7.25,"poster_path":"/o9xJ1xG1WKlHkl8ACqq0LShOuMu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":856,"logo_path":"/3tfzS2CrX6Ntbu927XzHXEPDA6y.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7658,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buena Vista International Film Production France","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alliance de Production Cinematographique (APC)","origin_country":""},{"id":66329,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Institut Polare Français Paul-Émile Victor","origin_country":""},{"id":66331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonne Pioche","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114038,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Geographic Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-01-26","revenue":127392239,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the harshest place on Earth, love finds a way.","title":"March of the Penguins","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":741}
