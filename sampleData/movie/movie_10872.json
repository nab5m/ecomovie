Indeed, they are so obsessed with belittling each other that they never stop -- not even at gunpoint. The gunman is Gus, a thief on the run from the police, who kidnaps the couple as an insurance policy, planning to use their home as a hideout. But their incessant bickering proves more than Gus bargained for, forcing him -- for the sake of his own sanity -- into the unenviable role of peacemaker. To make things even worse for Gus, he discovers that he has taken the couple hostage the night of their big Christmas party, and the guests are already on the way. Not wanting to leave Lloyd and Caroline unattended, Gus opts to attend the party, pretending to be the couple's marriage counselor. This naturally leads to a series of comic confusions, as the hostage crisis and marital tensions head towards their inevitable conclusion.","popularity":7.377,"poster_path":"/ym7Kx3iDmalK8kXKvVQwnFYABEV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9195,"logo_path":"/ou5BUbtulr6tIt699q6xJiEQTR9.png","name":"Touchstone Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-03-09","revenue":11439193,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They might be his hostages but what they're doing to this guy is criminal.","title":"The Ref","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":182}
